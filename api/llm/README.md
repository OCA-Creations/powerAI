# `PowerAI.llm`
## Overview
PowerAI was built to simplify interactions with all sorts of AIs. It is designed to simplify AIs for consumers not just for a specific AI, but for _all of them_. A large part of these AIs are LLMs (short for Large Language Models).
### LLMs
A Large Language Model is a language model fed massive amounts of data in order to learn things such as mathematical patterns.
